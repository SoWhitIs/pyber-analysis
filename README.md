# __ || PyBer, Ride-Share App  Analysis


## Overview of Project

PyBer, a ride-share app, is looking to expand its reach by improving accessibility to ride-sharing services, and set affordability, primarily to areas otherwise underserved.

Thusly, an analysis of the former's ride-share activity was conducted on data from January to early May of 2019, consisting of fares, number of rides, number of drivers by date (and time) and _per_ city type: Rural, Suburban, Urban, respectively. 

A second analysis consisted of a more focused or granular look on the fares by city type. 

Analysis is accompanied by visual aids as can be seen below and found [here.](https://github.com/SoWhitIs/pyber-analysis/tree/main/analysis)



### Resources
• Data Source (s): city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

• Software: Python 3.7.6 64-bit; Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy; Jupyter Notebook; Anaconda

When reviewing the _PyBer Summary_ as a whole we can see (chart below):

* While Rural ridership _is_ significantly less than that of the Urban ridership, on average , fares cost **$10 more**. 

* The amount of drivers in Urban Cities **far exceed** riders in the same geographic region, edging out with over 50%. _(Noted impact, Fig. 7, right)  <img align="right" src="analysis/Fig7.png">


* In Suburban Cities, on average drivers made about **$9 more _than_** the cost of the average ride. 


***
On the  hand, as in review of the below line graph for fares by city type we can see:
* Ridership in _all_ geographic regions took a dip in March, having had a steady climb from mid-late February 2019.
