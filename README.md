# _Let's Take A Ride_ || PyBer, Ride-Share App  Analysis


## Overview of Project

PyBer, a ride-share app, is looking to expand its reach by improving accessibility to ride-sharing services, and set affordability, primarily to areas otherwise underserved.

Thusly, an analysis of the former's ride-share activity was conducted on data from January to early May of 2019, consisting of fares, number of rides, number of drivers by date (and time) and _per_ city type: Rural, Suburban, Urban, respectively. 

A second analysis consisted of a more focused or granular look on the fares by city type. 

Analysis is accompanied by visual aids as can be seen below and found [here.](https://github.com/SoWhitIs/pyber-analysis/tree/main/analysis)



### Resources
• Data Source (s): city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

• Software: Python 3.7.6 64-bit | Python Libaries:Pandas,  Matplotlib, SciPy | Jupyter Notebook | Anaconda

**When reviewing the _PyBer Summary_ as a whole _we can see_ (chart below):**


* While Rural ridership _is_ significantly less than that of the Urban ridership, on average, fares cost **$10 more**. 

* The number of drivers in Urban Cities **far exceed** riders in the same geographic region, edging out with over 50%. _(Noted impact in Figure 7, right) _ <img align="right" src="analysis/Fig7.png">


* In Suburban Cities, on average drivers made about **$9 more _than_** the cost of the average ride.

 **On the other hand, when review of data illustrated in the below _PyBer  Total Fares, Per City Type, (Resampled, By Week)_ line graph _we can see_**:

* Ridership in _all_ geographic regions took a dip in at the start of March, having had a steady climb between the second to third weeks in February 2019. 

* Ridership in both Rural and Urban Cities increased at the end of March, with the two combined, yielding revenues of over $2500.

* Suburban ridership remained rather consistent in generated revenues, ranging from $500 to $1500.
